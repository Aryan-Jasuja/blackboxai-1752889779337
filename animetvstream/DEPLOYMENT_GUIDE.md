## 💰 Step 3: Make Money from Your Website

### Method 1: Google AdSense (Most Popular)

**What it is:** Google puts ads on your website, and you get paid when people click them!

**Step 3.1: Apply to Google AdSense**
1. Go to [adsense.google.com](https://adsense.google.com)
2. Click "Get started"
3. Enter your website URL (the Vercel link)
4. Choose your country
5. Wait for Google to approve you (can take 1-14 days)

**Step 3.2: Add Ads to Your Website**
1. Once approved, Google gives you "ad codes"
2. Replace the "Advertisement Space" in your website with real ads
3. Update this file: `src/components/AdBanner.tsx`

```typescript
// Replace the placeholder with real Google ads
export default function AdBanner({ size = 'medium' }: AdBannerProps) {
  return (
    <div className={`${sizeClasses[size]} ${className}`}>
      {/* Put your Google AdSense code here */}
      <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
      <ins className="adsbygoogle"
           style={{display:"block"}}
           data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
           data-ad-slot="XXXXXXXXXX"
           data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
      <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
    </div>
  );
}
```
